# MHYDAS-Small-Reservoirs

## Overview

MHYDAS-Small-Reservoirs is a new and original integrated, agro-hydrological model considering small reservoirs. The model explicitly represents relevant spatial scales (plot, small-reservoir, stream reach, groundwater, and catchment scales) and the agronomic and hydrological links between these scales at which
agriculture-hydrology interactions occur. 


## Software

MHYDAS-Small-Reservoirs model is made of a set of coupled simulators within the [OpenFLUID modelling platform](https://www.openfluid-project.org/).  
It is distributed as free and open-source software under the [GPL license](LICENSE).The MHYDAS-Small-Reservoir is composed of OpenFLUID simulators that are all hosted on the OpenFLUID WaresHub of LISAH at https://dev.openfluid-project.org/lisah-wareshub/report/.
